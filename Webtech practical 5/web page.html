<p style="color:blue;">With Capital Expenditure of over One Billion Rands invested in Campus Infrastructure, Richfield committed a further R100 million investment to improve the quality of teaching for learning by using technology in education. This learning initiative revolutionized and enhanced learning experiences in the education process in South Africa. Since 2012, over 100 000 Tablet PCs were acquired amounting to R118 million, which were made available to students registering for Higher and Further Education qualifications, free of charge, when they enroll at the College.
Students receive most of their learning material pre-loaded and readily available from their Tablet PC’s creating a culture of student-centeredness. The Tablet PC’s compact, convertible 
design allows students to comfortably make use of the device in small spaces. Tablet PCs also include wireless Wi-Fi, Tablet PC charging stations and internet support.

<h2 style="background-color:red; color:white">Moodle</h2>
<p style="color:blue;">Moodle is an online Learning Management System (LMS) enabling educators to create dynamic courses that extend learning, anytime, anywhere. Lecturers use Moodle to provide course materials such as handouts, lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations and may use Moodle in more interactive ways, which will require more input. Activities such as discussion forums, chat rooms, quizzes and assignment drop-boxes are often used. </p>
<h2 style="background-color:red; color:white">Library and E-Library</h2>
<p style="color:blue;">Higher Education students have the added advantage of accessing e–libraries irrespective of where they are, empowering them to draw from a wider range of research material from all over the world. Products of digital resources have been purchased with the aim to create a modern, accomplished, user-friendly and simple to use electronic library. The Institution has partnered with some of the world’s greatest academic digital publishers such as Elsevier Science Direct, Emerald Group Publishing, Springer Nature, PressReader and WARC Resources to provide free access to a range of e-newspapers, e-magazines, e-books, e-cases and e-journals to its students. The campus library consists not only of prescribed textbooks but also books of many categories such as fiction, non-fiction, reference materials and training collections. Richfield Graduate hosts their Annual Academic Library Conference. The conference is held to create an opportunity for academic book publishers, academics and librarians to engage on significant issues in support of quality library, information services & librarianship nationally. </p>

<p style="color:blue;">As its own initiative since 2000, the Institution had committed to a formal, Total Quality Management System and was accredited with the SABS ISO 9001: 2000 Quality Standard for all its campuses. While the revised SABS ISO 9001: 2008 standard supports and supplements the requirements of regulatory agencies including the HEQC and other ETQA’s; it was deemed necessary to migrate to ISO 9001:2015 standards. Richfield successfully completed a rigorous ISO international audit and is proud to announce its ISO 9001:2015 status together with OSHAS 18001:2007 Certification. The IQMF of the Institution is informed by the quality assurance
